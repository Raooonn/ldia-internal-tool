# LDIA – Week 2 Executive Note

## What was delivered
The initial data-to-insight pipeline was refactored using pandas,
enabling table-based analytics instead of manual list processing.

The tool now computes the same executive KPIs with less code and
greater flexibility.

## Business value
Using pandas allows the analysis to scale with larger datasets
and changing data structures, reducing maintenance risk.

This establishes a more robust foundation for forecasting,
scenario analysis, and internal dashboards.

## Improvement vs Week 1
- Fewer lines of code for the same output
- Column-based operations instead of manual loops
- Easier extensibility for future analytics modules

## Next steps
- Add time-based transformations for forecasting readiness
- Introduce baseline time-series models
- Prepare the pipeline for UI integration
